======

## Introduction 

This is a simple template for starting a [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.io)


## Usage 

To port this template into a gitbook, simply:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Create an account with gitbooks using your github account (or give gitbooks access to your github account if you already have a gitbooks account).
3. Login to gitbooks and click the "+ NEW" button.
3. Then select the "GITHUB" heading.
4. From there, you should see a drop-down menu showing all of your repos.  Choose this repo (named gitbook-template by default).
5. Feel free to change the title and add a description.  Once you hit "Create Book", you will have a basic gitbook!
